=head1 NAME

B<xstat_fs_test> - Gathers data collections from the File Server process.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use AFS::Monitor qw(xstat_fs_test);

  my $result = xstat_fs_test(
                             fsname => ["hostName1", "hostName2"],
                             collID => [0, 1, 2],
                            );

  foreach my $probe (@$result) {
    print "For host: $probe->{hostName}, ";
    print "Collection $probe->{collectionNumber}\n";
    if ($probe->{probeOK}) {
      print "probe successful\n";
    } else {
      print "probe failed\n";
    }
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<xstat_fs_test> function tests the routines in the B<libxstat_fs.a>
library and returns the data collections associated with the File Server (the
fs process).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<fsname>

String with one name or reference to an array with names of one or
more machines from which to monitor the File Server process.

=item B<collID>

Integer or reference to an array where each entry specifies each data collection
to return, which defines the type and amount of data the command interpreter
gathers about the File Server. Data is returned in a predefined data structure.

There are three acceptable values:

=over

=item B<0>

Provides profiling information about the numbers of times different internal
File Server routines were called since the File Server started. This value is
not currently implemented; it returns no data.

=item B<1>

Reports various internal performance statistics related to the File Server
(for example, vnode cache entries and Rx protocol activity).

=item B<2>

Reports all of the internal performance statistics provided by the 1 setting,
plus some additional, detailed performance figures about the File Server (for
example, minimum, maximum, and cumulative statistics regarding File Server
RPCs, how long they take to complete, and how many succeed).

=item B<3>

Only when compiled with OpenAFS-1.4.1 or newer.
Reports various internal CallBack statistics related to the File Server.

=back

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The returned value is a reference to an array. There is an entry in the array
for each collection gathered for each file server. Each entry in the array is
a reference to a hash, containing the following keys:

=over

=item B<hostName>

The name of the file server this data collection represents

=item B<collectionNumber>

The data collection number

=item B<probeTime>

The time the probe was initiated, measured in seconds since the Epoch
(00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970).

=item B<probeOK>

1 if the probe was successful, 0 if the probe failed.

=item B<data>

If the probe was not successful, this key will not exist. Otherwise, this
entry will contain a reference to a hash containing all of the data collected.
For details on the contents of this hash, and an example of printing it in a
readable format, refer to the B<xstat_fs_test> script in the B<examples>
directory.
