This is the README file for the Perl extension module AFS::Monitor (Version 0.3.3)


DESCRIPTION
    The AFS::Monitor module is a dynamically loadable extension to
    Perl. It gives the AFS user and administrator access to most of the
    AFS monitoring and debugging functions, allowing you to make these calls
    directly from Perl, rather than processing the output of a command.


REQUIREMENTS
    Before you can build the AFS module you need to have the
    following installed on your system:

        * Perl 5.6.1 or newer (haven't tested on any older versions)
        * system libraries for OpenAFS 1.2.x and newer (it is unknown
	whether IBM AFS wil work)


COMPATIBILITY
    Please consult the 'pod/Monitor.pod' file for a complete list of AFS
    @sys variable, OS and compiler versions this Perl module is known to
    work with


AVAILABILITY
    The latest version of the AFS::Monitor module is currently available at

 http://github.com/stevenjenkins/AFS-Monitor as well as CPAN.


BUILDING & INSTALLING
    Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, building the module
    should be straightforward. The AFS::Monitor module is distributed as a
    single gzipped tar archive file:

            AFS-Monitor-0.3.3.tar.gz

    Unpack the archive to create an AFS-Monitor installation directory:

        tar zxvf AFS-Monitor-0.3.3.tar.gz

    'cd' into that directory, make, test and install the modules. You
    have to specify the location of the AFS system libraries. While
    running the 'perl Makefile.PL' step you will be prompted for the
    location of the AFS system libraries.  If you want to avoid that
    query, you should specify the environment variable 'AFSPATH'
    before you start[1].  If your AFS system type is not yet known by
    the make file, please follow the printed message.

    This is the sequence of commands to build the modules:

        cd AFS-Monitor-0.3.2

        [1] this step is optional
        setenv AFSPATH 'path_to_the_AFS_system_libraries' # tcsh-shell
        export AFSPATH='path_to_the_AFS_system_libraries' # sh-shell

        perl Makefile.PL
             ---->  Which AFS system libraries should be used? [/usr/afsws]
        make
        make test
        make install


DOCUMENTATION
    POD-format documentation can be found in the directory 'pod'.
    The POD documentation gets automatically installed to the system wide
    Perl documentation. It is readable with the 'perldoc' utility.

    To create a HTML version of the documentation, execute

 cd pod
 make html


EXAMPLES
    The 'examples' directory contains example how to use the
    AFS::Monitor module. The scripts contain almost all ways how to call
    the different functions. We have used these scripts as regression tests
    during development. They should ive you enough ideas how to use the
    different functions.


BUGS
    Please send all bug reports and suggestions for improvements to
    Steven Jenkins <steven.jenkins@gmail.com>. When reporting
    bugs/problems please include information about operating system
    version, perl version, AFS version, AFS::Monitor module version.
    Comments, suggestions and patches are always welcome.
